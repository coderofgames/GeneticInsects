    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Genetic Insects Project Overview
========================================================================

Very similar to the Shakespeare monkeys program, this features improvements
a) the population has a sub-population, named in the code as "mating pool"
b) the mutation operator mutates 1 bit of the chromosome
c) the InsectChromosome is 1 integer in size, however uses bitfield operations to set genes
d) The program will breed an insect survivor based on initial parameters (hard coded atm)
